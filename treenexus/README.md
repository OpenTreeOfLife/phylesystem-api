The phylogenetic studies in this repository are synthesized into the
[Open Tree of Life](http://opentreeoflife.org) .

## The Open Tree Of Life NexSON Datastore

These studies are stored as JSON files, in the NexSON format. NexSON is simply
badgerfish conventions applied to NeXML.

## Getting involved

There is a #otol channel on the Freenode IRC network (chat.freenode.net).
